# Finding-Primes-iOS-App

This app finds prime numbers and is built using Xcode 7 and Swift 2.  The code was written and tested in Xcode playgrounds and then ported to the Xcode project.

## Concepts Used/Practiced:
* Xcode Auto Layout with constraints
* Functions in Swift
* Force unwrapping with ```!```
* Using ```if let```
* UIAlertController

## Notes:
* Apple values descriptive naming conventions.  They advise clarity and brevity, however clarity shouldn't be prioritized for the sake of brevity.
* Apple also advises to not abbreviate the names of things and to spell them out, even if they're long.
